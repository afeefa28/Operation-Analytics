 OperationOperation Analytics Project - Advanced SQL

Operations Analytics involves analyzing data across the entire operational spectrum of a company to derive meaningful insights that can guide decision-making processes. 
This type of analysis is crucial for understanding the efficiency of different departments such as operations, support, and marketing, and identifying improvement areas. As a Data Analyst Lead working for a company like Microsoft, your task is to leverage multiple datasets to provide insights that help various teams make informed decisions, automate processes, and optimize workflows.

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of job data and user engagement metrics to answer specific operational questions posed by different departments. This analysis will help the company to better understand its operations, predict growth trends, and enhance user engagement. The project is divided into two case studies:

A. Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis
   The first case study focuses on analyzing job-related data to gain insights into job reviews, throughput, language preferences, and duplicate data issues. The 
   following questions need to be addressed:

1. Number of Jobs Reviewed:
     - Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour per day for November 2020. This will provide insights into the job review patterns and help optimize the 
       review process.

2. Throughput Analysis:
     - Throughput is defined as the number of events happening per second. Calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput and provide a recommendation on 
       whether a daily metric or a 7-day rolling average is more appropriate for monitoring throughput.

3. Percentage Share of Each Language:
     - Calculate the percentage share of each language for different content types over the last 30 days. This insight is valuable for understanding language 
       preferences and tailoring content accordingly.

4. Identifying Duplicate Rows:
     - Duplicate rows in data can lead to inaccurate analysis. Identify and display duplicate rows in the job_data table to address potential data quality issues.

B. Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spikes
   The second case study involves analyzing user behavior and engagement metrics to identify patterns, spikes, and potential areas for improvement. The following 
   questions need to be addressed:

1. User Engagement:
     - Calculate the weekly user engagement to measure how active users are and whether they find value in the product or service. This will help in understanding 
      user behavior and tailoring engagement strategies.
2. User Growth:
     - Calculate the user growth for the product over time to assess how the user base is expanding. This metric is critical for understanding the adoption rate of 
       the product.

3. Weekly Retention:
     - Calculate the weekly retention rate of users based on a sign-up cohort. Retention is a key metric for understanding user loyalty and the long-term success 
       of the product.

4. Weekly Engagement by Device:
     - Calculate the weekly engagement metrics per device type to understand how different user segments engage with the product. This will help in optimizing the 
       user experience across various devices.
5. Email Engagement:
     - Calculate the email engagement metrics to assess how users interact with email communications. This is important for optimizing email marketing strategies 
       and improving user retention.


By conducting this analysis, you will provide the operations, support, marketing, and other cross-functional teams with data-driven insights to improve operational efficiency, user engagement, and overall company performance.
